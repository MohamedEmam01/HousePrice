# House Price Appreciation Project

This project aims to predict house price appreciation using machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques. It also includes data visualization to aid in decision-making. The web application is built using Flask to allow users to input data and obtain predictions.

## Files

- `final_revision.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the final version of the code used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It provides insights into the data exploration and machine learning process.
- `app.py`: This Python script sets up the Flask web application. It defines routes and handles user inputs, invokes the machine learning model, and displays the predictions on the web interface.
- `index.html`: This HTML file is the front-end of the web application. It allows users to enter relevant house features for which they want to predict the appreciation, and it displays the results.

## Web Application

To run the web application, ensure you have Flask installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

pip install flask

Then, execute the `app.py` script using:

python app.py

The application will start running locally, and you can access it through your web browser at `http://localhost:5000/`. The main page (`index.html`) will prompt you to enter the necessary data for prediction.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the machine learning model, the data goes through a preprocessing phase to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. The Jupyter Notebook `final_revision.ipynb` provides a detailed explanation of these steps.

## Machine Learning Algorithm

The machine learning algorithm used for this project is chosen based on its ability to handle regression tasks effectively. Details about the algorithm, model evaluation, and performance metrics can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `final_revision.ipynb`.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the dataset's characteristics and relationships between features. The Jupyter Notebook `final_revision.ipynb` includes visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Feedback and Questions

If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions regarding this project or the web application, please feel free to reach out. Your inputs are highly valuable in improving the project further.

Thank you for using this House Price Appreciation project! We hope you find it helpful in making informed decisions related to real estate investments.
